# :heavy_check_mark: SuperToDo

A ToDo web application stylized with Bootstrap and fully developed on Django.

This project was created as homework for Server-side Web Development subject of my Web Application Development formation.

## :wrench: Technologies

- `pip`
- `pip-venv`
- `Python`
- `Django`
- `HTML`

## :book: What I learned

### Django basics and the Model-View-Template pattern

I learned how use Django framework to create a fully backend application using Python, also I learned how it works using his Model-View-Template pattern (similar to MVC), where the model
represents the data but the view handle the business logic and the template display the information.

### `pip` as package manager and `pip-venv` for virtual environments

I use `pip` to install the dependencies (in this case, just Django), and learned how to save that dependencies into a `requeriments.txt` that helps me to, in a future, install all packages
with just one command. Also, I use `pip-venv` to create a virtual environment, keeping isolated the packages that I used in the project.

### Basics URL handling

With the `urls.py` file, I setup different routes to execute different views, thinking on model identifiers like the `task_slug` used for create dynamic urls.
